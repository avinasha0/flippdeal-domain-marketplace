# SIMPLE FIX FOR EMAIL ACTIVATION ERROR

## The Problem
Your production .env has `APP_URL=https://flippdeal.com/` but the activation URLs are being generated as `http://localhost/register/activate/...`

## The Solution
Update your production .env file:

```env
APP_URL=https://flippdeal.com
```

**Remove the trailing slash** - this is causing the URL generation issue.

## Steps:
1. Change `APP_URL=https://flippdeal.com/` to `APP_URL=https://flippdeal.com`
2. Run `php artisan config:clear` on production
3. Test registration

This will fix the activation email URLs and resolve the "Failed to send activation email" error.
