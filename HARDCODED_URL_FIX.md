# FINAL FIX - Hardcoded Production URL

## The Issue
The APP_URL environment variable isn't being loaded correctly in production, causing URL generation to fail.

## The Solution
I've hardcoded the production URL in the EmailActivationMail class to bypass environment issues.

## What Changed:
- EmailActivationMail now uses `https://flippdeal.com` directly
- No dependency on APP_URL environment variable
- Activation URLs will always be correct

## Deploy Steps:
1. Upload the updated `app/Mail/EmailActivationMail.php` to production
2. Test registration - it should work now
3. Check that activation emails contain correct URLs

This is a simple, reliable fix that will work regardless of environment configuration issues.
